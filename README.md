# pet-tutorial-truffle-eth

This is my first time building an Ethereum dapp. Using Truffle's development environment, Ganache's local blockchain, and MetaMask's web3 transactional services, I was able to create a dapp which allows you to adopt pets online using Ethereum. Now, you can't actually adopt pets with real Ethereum. This was just to test how Ethereum works, how you can set up a blockchain and interact with it, and how many developers are now building their own solutions on this public infrastructure.
